### Scripting
A big feature of Grasshopper is the ability to actually _script_ inside a scripting node. You can do so in VB.net, C#, and most importantly Python. Latter being also the probably easiest choice. It is encouraged to write in your IDE of choice, with the help of [IronPython stubs](https://github.com/gtalarico/ironpython-stubs).
